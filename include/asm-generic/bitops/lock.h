<<<<<<< HEAD
 * This operation is like clear_bit_unlock, however it is not atomic.
 * It does provide release barrier semantics so it can be used to unlock
 * a bit lock, however it would only be used if no other CPU can modify
 * any bits in the memory until the lock is released (a good example is
 * if the bit lock itself protects access to the other bits in the word).

=======
 * A weaker form of clear_bit_unlock() as used by __bit_lock_unlock(). If all
 * the bits in the word are protected by this lock some archs can use weaker
 * ops to safely unlock.
 *
 * See for example x86's implementation.
